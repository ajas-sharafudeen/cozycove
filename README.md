# CozyCove
============

CozyCove is a feature-rich web application where users can list, discover, and book unique accommodations around the world.

The primary aim of this project is to gain hands-on experience with full-stack web development by recreating a complex application. Through this, I will enhance my skills in React, Node.js, and MongoDB while exploring new technologies and best practices.
